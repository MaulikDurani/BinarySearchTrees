## How To Compile

To compile the Java program, you can use the following command:

```bash
java -cp bin src/cs2720/p1/Driver.java resources
```
Additionally, you can also use the provided `compile.sh` script for compilation.
```
./compile.sh
```
Make sure to have the necessary Java environment set up on your machine.

## Available Commands
```The program supports the following commands:
(i) - Insert Item
(d) - Delete Item
(p) - Print Tree
(r) - Retrieve Item
(l) - Count Leaf Nodes
(s) - Find Single Parents
(c) - Find Cousins
(q) - Quit program
```
## Contributions
Ryan Majd: Implemented recursive methods, insertion, deletion, `Driver.java`, UML Diagram, `readme.md` search.

Maulik Durani: Implemented the Binary Search Tree structure, initial structure of insertion, Get Single Parents, Get Cousins, and Num Leaf Nodes.
